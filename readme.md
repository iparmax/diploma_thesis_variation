# Background

This is a variation of the my Diploma Thesis "Spatial Analysis of driver safety behaviour using data from smartphones"

Instead of performing linear regression, a neural network is trained to try and predict a unified rate of harsh events in Leoforos Mesogeion, dependent only on the behaviour of the driver during the event.
The master table is a result of spatial processing thought the ArcMap Software
